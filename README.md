`nomen` is a miniature CLI for easily creating, updating, and removing aliases from your terminal.

# Much to come, lots to do
nomen is still very much a work in progress. There are some immediate features that will follow shortly:
- Add a config command to configure where to place aliases
- Add more rebust error handling

Some features that I would like to add, but I'm unsure about their scope:
- Add support for zsh, possibly powershell
- auto-completion

## Contribute!
This is a solo project for the meantime, however, I would love to have others contribute!
